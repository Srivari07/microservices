# microservices

Microservices, also known as Microservices Architecture, is basically an SDLC approach in which large applications are built as a collection of small functional modules. It is one of the most widely adopted architectural concepts within software development. In addition to helping in easy maintenance, this architecture also makes development faster. Additionally, microservices are also a big asset for the latest methods of software development such as DevOps and Agile. Furthermore, it helps deliver large, complex applications promptly, frequently, and reliably. Applications are modeled as collections of services, which are: 

- Maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Designed or organized around business capabilities
- Managed by a small team
